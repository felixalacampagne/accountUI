# Accountui

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.3.

26-Sep-2022
It was originally started with Angular 5 but it proved impossible to figure out what changes were needed to get
that version to run the 'ng build' when Angular was updated to 14. The the only solution was to create a new project from scratch and copy the actual code from the Angular 5 version into the new project. The builder at least ran on the new project, all that was left to do was fix all the bugs which suddenly appeared in the previously successful compiling code.

The end result of a few days of work was finally a compiling version of the same code. Hopefully this pain wont be needed again for a couple of years.

One bug was fixed during to port to Angular 14: the reason for the failure to clear the transaction fields and update 
the transaction list post submission was discovered - failure to parse the non-json response as json!! Took a while to figure out how to stop the json parsing but it now seems to work as expected - finally!

There is at least one new piece of functionality: a formatted EPC,. mobile payment, text can now be parsed into a transaction. Such texts are usually seen as QR codes so a QR code can be used to make a payment via the banking app and the same QR code can be used to make the entry into Account. It's a bit clumsy as there is no way to access the clipboard and unfortunately the iPhone 'Scan Text' option which appears sometimes is not capable of decoding a QR.

QR reader can be invoked directly from the account web page. This is made possible by: 
http://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode. 
The behaviour is a bit crude, even after hours and hours of forking around with CSS, however it is certainly usable and definitely better than having to paste the result of an external scan into a text field. The downside is that the page must be served from a HTTPS server. Luckily my server already had an HTTPS version which account seems to work with, even on the iPhone using the VPN.

TODO: Make the scanner automatically request the permissions if necessary. It's a stupid unnecessary action which seems to be required each time the page is loaded - multiple uses of the scanner in the same 'session' do not require the permissions to be granted each time.

TODO: Close and remove the scanner when no scan is to be performed. Only way to do this at the moment is to reload the page.

TODO: Make the scanner into a component which can be displayed floating over the page like a dialog, with the page darkened. This is a real 'nice to have' since I managed to get some sort of control over the position of the scanner in the main page without messing up everything else.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build --configuration production` to build the project for installation on webserver. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
